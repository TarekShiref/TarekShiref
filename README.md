### Hi there 👋 I'm Tarek!

I'm an aspiring developer excited about building cross-platform apps and learning how the web works. I'm currently focused on expanding my skills and turning new ideas into code!

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning & Exploring

Here are the key technologies I'm focused on right now:

* **Flutter & Dart:** Deep diving into creating beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
* **Swift:** Exploring native iOS development and the Apple ecosystem.

## 🚀 My Goals

I'm focused on projects that help me solidify these core concepts:

* Learning by Building Efficiently: I am actively applying my beginner skills in Flutter/Dart, HTML, and Swift
  with a strong focus on optimizing performance, minimizing resource usage, and writing clean, lightweight code.
* Understanding the core architecture differences between Dart and Swift.

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

I'm always open to connecting with other developers, finding study partners, and discussing new projects!
